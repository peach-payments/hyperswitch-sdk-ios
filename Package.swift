// Swift Package Manager distribution, alongside CocoaPods.
//
// Each binaryTarget points at a per-xcframework zip on the GitHub release for its tag, with a
// checksum. build-lib.sh emits those zips and rewrites the urls and checksums here as part of
// cutting a release, so a merchant can depend on this package by version without a checkout.
//
// React Native 0.87 ships its core prebuilt, so React.xcframework and friends are vendored
// rather than compiled. Building the React module needs the flattened <react/...>, <yoga/...>
// and folly/glog/boost headers on an include path -- the same requirement the podspec has.
// headerSearchPath may leave the target but not the package, which our layout satisfies.

// React Native 0.87 ships its core prebuilt, so React.xcframework and friends are vendored
// rather than compiled.
//
// Building the React module needs <react/...>, <yoga/...> and the folly/glog/boost headers
// reachable, and React.framework's own headers include several of them BY PATH. Against a
// loose header tree those includes are non-modular and raise
// -Werror=non-modular-include-in-framework-module. The podspec suppresses that with
// OTHER_CFLAGS; SPM's only equivalent is .unsafeFlags, which it forbids for packages consumed
// by version -- the way merchants add this one -- so that route was closed. Making the loose
// tree a module instead produced a React <-> headers cycle, since the tree's own headers
// include <React/...>.
//
// Upstream's prebuilt tarball already solves it: alongside React.xcframework it ships
// ReactNativeHeaders.xcframework, headers-only, carrying all 29 namespaces. Those headers are
// modular because they belong to a real binary artifact, which is exactly what both failed
// approaches lacked. CocoaPods cannot use it -- it refuses a vendored xcframework containing
// static libraries, and the stub .a is what makes it work for SPM -- so the two distributions
// take different artifacts from the same build: SPM the xcframework, CocoaPods the flattened
// header tree.
//
// The three Objective-C bridge shims live in a sibling target because SPM has no
// mixed-language targets. There is no compile-time coupling in either direction: they register
// Swift classes with the React Native bridge by name at runtime and none imports the generated
// -Swift.h.
//
// binaryTarget urls and checksums are rewritten per release by build-lib.sh.
